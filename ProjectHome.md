Programming a bot is done writing a Python class, thanks to the SirBot API. A protocol declaration syntax is used to define what can be done (primitive/complex actions). Using a Python CLI, the robot can be interactively controlled and dynamically programmed. While the bot is performing several actions, every piece of information is able to produce events, thanks to the event declaration syntax. Events can also be created from other events (cascading events), conditionnaly triggered under specific conditions (pre-condition), and activate user-defined actions (post-conditions) according to a particular event state. The SirBot Module library provides detailed instructions to build electronic boards (PIC-based) and connect them to build a robot.
